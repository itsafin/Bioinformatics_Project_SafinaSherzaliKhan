An ORF (Open Reading Frame) finder is a bioinformatics tool that scans DNA sequences to identify potential protein-coding regions by locating start and stop codons across all six reading frames. It aids gene prediction and annotation by highlighting candidate translational regions and their lengths. ORF finders are widely used in genome annotation, gene discovery, and sequence validation, often integrated into pipelines with translation and motif analysis.
